## new projects ?

I am currently rotating in labs at JHU to determine what I'll work on next!


## scRNA-seq and microarray subtype discovery method

#### Our method, PHet, is able to distinguish multiple subtypes of data given only two labels (control and case)

*Summary of Abstract*

In disease diagnosis and targeted therapy, discovering subtypes is crucial as cells or patients can exhibit varied responses to treatments. Hence, understanding the heterogeneity of disease states is vital for comprehending pathological processes. However, selecting features for subtyping from high-dimensional datasets is challenging, with many algorithms focusing on known disease phenotypes and potentially overlooking valuable subtyping information. Our study aimed to address this issue by identifying feature sets that preserve heterogeneity while discriminating known disease states. Through a data-driven approach combining feature clustering and deep metric learning, we developed a statistical method called PHet (Preserving Heterogeneity). This method effectively identifies a minimal set of features that maintain heterogeneity while maximizing the quality of subtype clustering. PHet outperformed previous methods in identifying disease subtypes using microarray and single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Our research provides an innovative feature selection method that facilitates personalized medicine and enhances understanding of disease heterogeneity.

## image analysis of live-cell imaging

While working for [Dr. Kwonmoo Lee](https://research.childrenshospital.org/kwonmoo-lee/) at Boston Children's Hospital, I developed strong computational tools and skills to analyze images. My work included using various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cell segmentation, utilizing cell tracking algorithms, and honing my image analytic stills (Fiji).
