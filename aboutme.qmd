Hi! My name is Caleb Hallinan and I am a first-year PhD student in BME at Johns Hopkins. During my graduate studies, I hope to develop user-friendly computational software specifically tailored for biologists who may not be as tech-savvy. I was recently introduced to spatial transcriptomics (ST) and immediately captivated, so I am thrilled to explore this field during my rotation with Dr. Fan in the [JEFworks Lab](https://jef.works/)! My proficiencies lie in the domains of data analysis, machine learning, and the development and implementation of high-end computational research tools.

Ultimately, I would love to become a Teaching Professor at a University one day. I have a passion for teaching and mentoring others, and what better way to do that than helping train the next generation of scientists :)

When I'm not busy with research, you'll find me playing/watching sports, hanging out with friends, or watching movies :)
